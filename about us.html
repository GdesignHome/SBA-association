                <p><font class="w">W</font>elcome to the Silence Breakers Academy, where dance and theater intertwine to create captivating performances. We are a group of passionate deaf dancers and actors who are breaking barriers and redefining artistic expression. Silence Breakers Academy was birthed  on the 27th of August 2023 after several months of planning and designing. It is an Academy solely made up of Persons with hard of hearing or simply Deaf persons from the Grass field region of the Northwest. The initiative came from the deafs who felt it was time to let Cameroon, Africa, and the world  know that there is more to the deaf community tham just speaking with hands. It is a group of young vibrant Girls and Boys with the passion to explore and make use of their talents and skills.<br><font class="a">A</font>t Silence Breakers Academy, our mission is to challenge perceptions, inspire change, and communicate through the powerful mediums of dance and theater. As deaf performers, we use movement, gestures, and visual storytelling to convey emotions and narratives. </p>
